# 17th IFIP TC.13 International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction

## <center>Interactive Posters</center>
- Submissions for Interactive Posters are invited, addressing any area of HCI, including those identified in the conference topics. Practitioners and researchers are encouraged to submit Interactive Posters as it provides a unique opportunity for sharing valuable ideas, eliciting useful feedback on early-stage work, and fostering discussions and collaborations among colleagues.

- Authors are encouraged to demonstrate late-breaking research results and work in progress that reports stimulating and innovative ideas. Interactive Poster submissions should report original work and must not have been published previously.

- Interactive Poster submissions are juried by an international panel of experts. Accepted posters must be presented at the conference during a special poster session. Poster papers will appear in the INTERACT 2019 conference proceedings.

### **Interactive Poster**
An Interactive Poster is a concise report of recent findings or other types of innovative or thought-provoking work relevant to the INTERACT community.

The difference between Interactive Poster and other contribution types (e.g. papers and notes) is that Interactive Poster submissions represents work that has not reached a level of completion that would warrant the full refereed selection process. That said, appropriate submissions should make some contribution to the body of HCI knowledge, whether realized or promised.

A significant benefit of an Interactive Poster derives from the discussion between the author and conference attendees that will be fostered by the face-to-face presentation of the work. This submission category aims to attract participation from a broad range of disciplines covering a spectrum of topics and methodologies.

Summaries of completed work or reduced versions of short or full paper submissions are inappropriate as an Interactive Poster submission and will be rejected.

Submissions may include, but are not limited to, the following types of work:

- Evaluations of systems, techniques, practices or other phenomena relevant to HCI.
- Descriptions of new methods, processes, techniques, or tools for use in interactive system design, development or deployment.
- Reflections from practice, including lessons learned or principles derived from real-world experiences and backed by thought-provoking and well-substantiated analyses.
- Accounts of the design (rationale, process, outcomes and/or evaluation) of innovative applications, user interfaces, or systems.
### Preparing and Submitting an Interactive Poster
Interactive Poster submissions must consist of two related documents:

- A poster extended abstract prepared in the [Springer LNCS](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines?countryChanged=true) format and submitted as a PDF file. Poster extended abstract should be camera-ready and thoroughly copy-edited. Interactive Poster submissions need not be anonymous.
- An electronic version of the poster that you will present at the conference. For the review process, your poster should be reduced to one standard page in size (A4) and submitted as a PDF file. Please note that the physical posters presented at the conference may not be larger than A0 format.

Due to the short review cycle, there should be nearly no changes between your submission and the camera-ready final document, except in rare circumstances.

Both the poster extended abstract and the poster should communicate:

- A concise description of the work
- Implications of the work for the INTERACT community
- Recommendations for further investigation and/or incorporation into practice

### Submission
Submissions are accepted via PCS. To start the process or create an account [click here](https://new.precisionconference.com/user/login?society=interact).


### Selection Process
Interactive Poster submissions will be selected by an anonymous jury. The process has been designed to acknowledge the early-stage nature of the work. All submissions are considered confidential during the review process.


### Review Criteria
Each submission will be reviewed on the following criteria:

**1.** Significance: How important is the problem or question that this submission addresses? How important is the output of this work in contributing to the identified problem or question? How greatly can others benefit from this work?
 
**2.** Originality: How novel is the contribution? How clearly does the submission communicate the ways that it differs from and goes beyond the most relevant previous work in this area? (Note that for an Interactive Poster submission, full literature searches are not expected, although the most relevant citations should be included).

**3.**  Validity: How appropriate are the chosen methods for the work being undertaken? How well are the submissionâ€™s claims and conclusions supported by the results?

**4.**  Written Presentation: How clear and understandable is the writing in the poster abstract? To what extent does the poster abstract conform to conference formatting requirements and the 4-page limit?

**5.**  Visual Presentation (The Poster): How well does the design of the poster effectively communicate the most important facets of the work? To what degree is the design of the poster likely to draw in an audience?

**6.**  Ability of the Work to Engender Discussion: To what degree will the presentation of this work stimulate interesting conversation among researchers or practitioners? To what extent will the presenters benefit from being able to discuss their work and receive feedback at this stage?

### Upon Acceptance of your submission
Interactive poster authors will be notified of acceptance. If a submission is accepted to appear at the conference, the contact person will receive further instructions regarding the inclusion of their poster abstract in the conference proceedings, as well as instructions for the poster presentation at the conference.


### At the Conference
Accepted Interactive Posters will be displayed during the conference. Authors will be expected to attend the conference and will be assigned a time and location to present their poster to conference attendees. Authors will be required to set up beforehand and stand with their posters during the assigned time.
